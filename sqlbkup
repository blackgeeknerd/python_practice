Transaction Log Backup
	A transaction log backup contains all log records that have not been included in the last transaction log backup.
	 A transaction log file stores a series of the logs that provide the history of every modification of data, in a database
	It allows the database to be recovered to a specific point in time. This means that the transaction log backups are incremental and differential backups are cumulative in nature
